###Case Study - Predicting Housing Prices

Explore regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection. Handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity. Analyze the impact of aspects of the data -- such as outliers -- on selected models and predictions. Implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.

   -Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
   
   -Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
   
   -Tune parameters with cross validation.
   
   -Analyze the performance of the model.
   
   -Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
   
   -Deploy methods to select between models.
   
   -Exploit the model to form predictions. 
   
   -Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.
   
   -Implement these techniques in Python.
