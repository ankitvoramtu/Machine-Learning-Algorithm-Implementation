CODE INSTRUCTION
To run the code, please use Spyder IDE (version 2.3.8 for mac OS, https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/tag/v2.3.8) with attached custom sklearn library (merged version of 0.17, 0.18 dev, 0.19 dev versions) to replace the sklearn library  in the Spyder IDE folder (Spyder-Py2.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.7). Please keep all subfolders (including Code folder, Dataset folder and Figures folder) in the zxie66 folder to run the program.

DOCUMENT INSTRUCTION
The zxie66 folder includes the following subfolders or document:
1. Dataset folder includes two datasets for this analysis - voice.csv and EEG data.csv
2. Code folder contains two python documents: 
1) DataAnalysis.py - this document includes code to generate two figures for feature analysis for two datasets, and to compute the basic information of datasets.
2) ClassifierAnalysis.py - this document includes code to generate learning curves and validation curves, and to search the optimize parameters for each classifier.
The python code was written with the Spyder IDE (version 2.3.8) on mac OS X El Capitan (version 10.11.4). The version of python is Python 2.7.10. The following libraries were used to support the code: a). pandas (version 0.17.1), b). seaborn (version 0.6.0), c). matplotlib (version1.5.0), d). numpy (version 1.10.1), e). sklearn (version 0.17, 0.18 dev for tree class, 0.19 dev for neural network, svm and neighbors classes), the merged sklearn was included in the zxie66 folder.
NOTE for sklearn: because some new features such as tree pruning are not included in the old 0.17 version, the custom sklearn library was created. The latest dev 0.18 and 0.19 versions of sklearn was downloaded from https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn. To install the new class, please follow the following steps with mac terminal:  1). install pip on mac using command sudo easy_install pip, 2). install cython by running csh sudo pip install cython, 3). direct to the class folder and convert .pyx to .c by running cython -a xx.pyx, 4). direct to the class folder run python setup.py install 
3. Figures folder includes all figures generated by the code in the  Code folder.
4. sklearn folder - modified sklearn library (merged version of 0.17, 0.18 dev, 0.19 dev versions).
5. zxie66-analysis.pdf document- a pdf document with analyses and interpretations for the results generated by the code in the Code folder.
6. README.txt document- a document with instructions for documents and to run code.
